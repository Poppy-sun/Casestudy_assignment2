Starting the Parallel Pool:
Before running the parallel GMRES code (Q3), open MATLAB and start the parallel pool by entering the following command in the MATLAB command window:
parpool;
This will initialize the parallel environment needed for the parallel computations.

Executing the Code:
Run each script in order.
Each script will automatically generate the required plots and output files.
